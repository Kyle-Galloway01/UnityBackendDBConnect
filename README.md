This script enables interaction between Unity and a SQL database. It allows users to connect to a database, execute SQL queries, retrieve data based on specified parameters (e.g., player name, school), and apply it to objects within the Unity environment.

## Features

- **Database Connectivity:** Connects Unity to a SQL database using a specified connection string.
- **SQL Query Execution:** Executes SQL queries to search for specific data based on user-defined parameters.
- **Data Retrieval:** Retrieves data from the database and applies it to objects within the Unity environment.
- **Customizable:** Can be customized to support additional database operations and object properties.

## Usage

1. **Attach Script:** Attach the provided script to a GameObject in your Unity scene.
2. **Configure Connection:** Specify the connection string for your SQL database in the Unity editor.
3. **Set Parameters:** Define the parameters for the data you want to retrieve (e.g., player name, school, date, pitch type).
4. **Assign GameObject:** Assign the GameObject in the Unity scene to which you want to apply the retrieved data.
5. **Run Scene:** Run the Unity scene to execute the script and interact with the SQL database.

*Note: Ensure proper permissions and access controls are set up for the SQL database to prevent unauthorized access.*
